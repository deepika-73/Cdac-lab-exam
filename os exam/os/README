#To compile a prog execute the following:

gcc -pthread [-o <your_executable_location>] <C_Program>

$gcc -pthread -o /tmp/dac_orphan.o Orphan.c 

# Before compiling, its a safe step to delete the output (.o) file.
# Reason is, if your new code changes fail at compile time, then your 
# old executable will not be replaced. And you might end up running some
# old code.
